# Lucius Colorscheme fro VSCode

This is an implementation of the [Lucius](https://github.com/jonathanfilip/vim-lucius) colorscheme for VS Code.
Right now, I only paid attention to the low contrast profile because I use this and to C/C++ and Markdown.
I will adapt and extend the scheme as I go along.

## Install

Copy it into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code.

At some point, I might publish this on the marketplace.
